To run the code, run the environment.yml and that should allow you to run the code.

To run the code, run "python pipeline.py", this will train the model 20 "epochs" and then test it with 1000 samples. 
After running the code, you can create the graphs by running lossgrapher.py

The model is stored in model.py

You need the data to run the code. Simply download and unzip from https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/ and then put it in the base of this repository for the code to work.
